# Weather-Dashboard

This is a Web based weather application, which allowed the user to search for a city and receive current weather conditions as well as the future 5 day forecast for the city. This application allows the user to see the current temperature, wind, humidity, and UV index for earch particular city searched, and the projected temperature, wind, humidity and UV index of the city in interest. 

# Description 

Build a Weather Dashboard application from scratch using the skills we have learned from the previous weeks. To complete this assignment I will use my knowledge in HTML to create an index.html  file which is linked to a CSS file, as well as a javascript file. I will use my understanding of CSS to make the application visually appealing to the user, and my knowledge of javascript to make the program run and function the way that i want it to function. The user will be able to enter in a city and see the cities current temperature, wind, humidity, and UV index, as well as a projected 5-day forecast for the city. 

# Tasks Completed

1. Created basic HTML template with a header, main, body and footer sections. 
2. Created a basic CSS file, and linked it to the index.html file. 
3. Created a basic script.js file, and linked it to the index.html file. 
4. Expanded the index.html file to fit the needs for the project, as well as assigned variable names for both html and script files.
5. Added a container to hold the current searched city's weather data.
6. Added a container to hold the same searched city's 5 day forecast, with 5 columns.  
7. Added a jumbotron section for the top of the page, with the title of the application. 
8. Added a selectable JQuery container, for popular cities as well as a search bar, to look up whatever city the user needed. 
9. Added a moment function to get the current date for the forecast dates. 
10. Used openWeatherAPI to retreive the city's weather information to populate on the given sections of the application.
